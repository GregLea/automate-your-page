      <div class="text">The World Wide Web started early in the 1990s and has grown exponentially since then.
        <br> The Web consists of HTML documents, where hyperlinks connect the pages like a web.
        <br> HTML or hypertext markup language is the code that runs webpages like this one.
        <br> When a person goes to a web page like <a href="www.google.com">Google</a>, their computer sends an HTTP request to a server.
        <br> The server finds the right HTML document, and sends it back to the person's computer to be displayed.

      <div class="text">Tags are bits of HTML code that instruct the computer on what to do.
        <br> Many tags have an opening tag and a closing tag, but there are a expections to this rule, such as the
        <br> tag for a line break.
        <br> Tags tell the computer how an HTML document should look.

      <div class="text">Some HTML elements are known as inline because the formatting they create
        <br> appears inline with the text. Other elemetns are block elements because they make
        <br> an invisible box around the content that is placed inside the tags.

        Computer Science
    </div>
    <div class="text">
         Computer science is a scientific and practical approach to both problem solving and programming.
Thinking in a mechanical way, by breaking down problems into smaller pieces or steps that can be solved as you go.
A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and design.

        Programming languages.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
         A computer program is simply a list of instructions that direct a computer on what to do and how to do it.
Because computers don't think, these instructions have to be very specific and in a specific language that the computer can understand.
These languages are programming languages, like C++ or Python. While it would be nice to use a language like english to program
a computer, our native languages are too ambigious for a computer to completely understand, until we achieve AI.

        Python
    </div>
    <div class="text">
         Python is a "programming language." It is an easy way to write computer code that has established data structures and definitions.
Python is a common and accepted computer language that I'm only just beginning to understand completely.

        Print function
    </div>
    <div class="text">
         The Print funciont within Python is the simpliest expression I know. It tells Python to print out the result or number that results 
from the program as written. Spaces between the print funcion and the item printed on the line don't matter.

        Variables
    </div>
    <div class="text">
          Names can be used to keep track of many things, from numbers to text. When creating a variable, you
give the variable a name and then assign it some expression. The = sign is used to assign a named variable it's expression.
For example, the Speed of Light = 29979245. Variables can be altered by what the program tells it the new variable is. 
This is a powerful tool in making programs that can do many complicated things.
Other signs can be used to change the variables as well. The + sign will add something to the variable (ie: hours = hours + 1).
The * sign will do multiplication.

        Strings
    </div>
    <div class="text">
         Strings are a sequence of characters between single or double quotes. The quote types much match.
The + sign can add things to strings as well. Python can locate parts of a string by using the [] function.
It is important to remember that Python starts counting from 0 and not 1 when it looks at a string.
So when trying to find the first letter in a string, it is going to be stringname[0] and not [1]. The : will allow
us to find parts of a string from the starting position, to the stopping position, [0:5] for example.

        Find operation
    </div>
    <div class="text">
         The Find method can find any or all instances of what you are looking for in a string. The output of the find
is the position of the first occurance in the string. This is done with string.find(string). The find function can use
one or more parameters in it's find function, which greatly expands its use. Passing in a number can tell the find function
where in the string to start the search.

        Functions and Inputs
    </div>
    <div class="text">
         The def funtion allows us to define a string using an input as entered by the user. Def string(n): allows us to define
a string by what we input into the program, which is n in this case, and since there is only one input, only one input will be accepted.
Def string(a,b,c) would be looking for 3 inputs when defining that string. 
With these inputs, we can use programming to alter that string and print out or return new results.
When making functions, PRINT gives the value to the users as an output string and the program loses the value. Whereas,
RETURN will give the value back to the program, so that internal functions can still work.

        Flows and Loops
    </div>
    <div class="text">
         If, While and For can make loops when programming in Python. This allows a function to occure over and over again
until some end function or endstate is met. If statements are like IF/THEN in basic. If a certain condition is met,
then return or print the outcome. If it is not met, then move to the next line of code. The While statement creates a loop
that will keep running, until the condition is shown to be false (while n < 0, for example). The For statement
will move through a collection of ready made inputs or lists and then completes.
